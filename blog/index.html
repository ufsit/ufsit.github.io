  <p>Happy belated Halloween SIT!</p>

<p>Hope everyone&rsquo;s weekend was full of costumes and candy. While pumpkins and skeletons were fun, its time to start looking forward to Thanksgiving!!</p>

<p>This week, we&rsquo;ll be taking a look at Reverse Engineering. This is the process of disassembling an executable file to understand its functions, processes, variables, etc. With this information known, it is possible to find a vulnerability which can be exploited with a malicious injection. In this way, an attacker can hijack execution control of a program to execute desired functions (getflag()) or even execute arbitrary code. We will be taking a look at the most common tool for this, which is GDB, the GNU debugger. This is a hugely important topic for CTFs and cyber security in general, so I highly recommend to come out!</p>

<p>Also, this Friday, at 7pm, in CSE 312, we will be having a CTF event! Join us as we participate in the HackTheVote online CTF. We will be providing food!</p>

<p><strong><strong> FREE FOOD AT THE CTF </strong></strong>*</p>

<p>Come on out for a fun night of hacking!</p>

  <p>Hey SIT!</p>

<p>Hopefully everyone had a nice, long weekend, safe from Hurricane Matthew. Best wishes to everyone who has friends and family in the thick of the storm.</p>

<p>Since our Buffer Overflow meeting was cancelled last week, we will be having it this week instead. This is an extremely important and fundamental technique for hackers, so I highly recommend coming out.</p>

<p>Stay tuned on our facebook and mailing list for a possible CTF this Friday!</p>

  <p>Welcome to another week SIT! We have a lot of exciting events planned.</p>

<p>Firstly, congratulations to everyone who participated in the TUMCTF. It was a pretty challenging event overall, but we managed to come out ranked 89th out of 434 competing teams. Great job! It was a great time hanging out all night trying to crack challenges. #trackmania</p>

<p>This week&rsquo;s meeting will feature Buffer Overflows. This is another fundamental weapon in a hacker&rsquo;s arsenal, I definitely recommend coming out! We will be showing how to hijack the execution of a program using stack based overflows, letting you execute arbitrary code or run a program in unintended ways. We will be providing a hands-on exercise after the presentation for you to apply your newly-found powers to exploit some vulnerable programs.</p>

<p>Finally, there will NOT be a CTF event this Friday Oct. 5th. Instead, make sure to come out to our Ropes Course Social at Lake Wauburg on Saturday! It will be a ton of fun, so definitely come out! We will be providing free food!</p>

  <p>Hey SIT!</p>

<p>Great job on our performance for the Hack1t CTF!! The CTF is still online until the end of this week, but we will be shifting focus to a new CTF this Friday. At one time during the CTF, we were 2nd place in the world! As of now, we are still hanging out in top 100 of the rankings. Awesome job everyone!</p>

<p>This week&rsquo;s meeting will feature an Introduction to SQL Injection by our very own president, Terry Thibault. SQL Injection is an extremely important technique to know, as it is one of the most prevalent vulnerabilities year after year. People simply don&rsquo;t care about sanitizing input! Find out how to exploit their laziness and pwn a system this Thursday as Terry walks us through the process, from SQL to Shell.</p>

<p>Also, don&rsquo;t forget to sign up for our Ropes Course Social at Lake Wauburg on October 8th! Check out our Facebook event for details and carpooling.</p>

  <p>What&rsquo;s up SIT!</p>

<p>Hope everyone had a great time with the CSAW CTF event this past weekend. Our team placed top 27 in the nation and top 10% in the world! Thanks to everyone who showed up, and congratulations!</p>

<p>This week&rsquo;s meeting will feature explanations and write-ups of several CTF challenges that were completed at CSAW. If you were struggling with a particular challenge, this is the perfect way to see the solution worked out in real time.</p>

<p>In addition, we will be having a hands-on lab to learn vital Linux and recon skills. Don&rsquo;t miss it!</p>
